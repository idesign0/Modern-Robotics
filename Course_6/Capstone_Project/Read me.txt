Software Implementation Summary and Results

This document provides an overview of the software implementation for controlling the KUKA YouBot using MATLAB. The main developments are:

1) Odometry Implementation: Defined the relationship between the base frame parameters (orientation Ï•, X, Y) and the wheel velocities/positions to ensure accurate localization.
Trajectory Planning: Generated a reference trajectory for guiding the YouBot controller.

2) Jacobian Development: Created manipulator and base Jacobians to translate joint and wheel velocities into end-effector velocities.

3) Control Algorithm Design: Developed a feed-forward PI controller to manage robot navigation, incorporating joint and velocity constraints for safe operation.

4) Singularity Management: Applied a pseudo-inverse approach to address singularities, stabilize computations, and handle critical edge cases.

5) Gain Optimization: Optimized gain parameters to ensure smooth and stable motion.

During the implementation process, unexpected challenges arose, particularly in tuning the gain matrix, which required a more detailed analysis than initially planned. Additionally, the project description did not fully cover the complexities of singularity avoidance, which led to the need for independent solutions.

Overall, these enhancements have significantly improved the system's performance, as demonstrated by the results. The comparison between the basic and improved implementations highlights the advantages, particularly in terms of stability and efficiency.
