# **Modern Robotics Specialization ‚Äì Project Repository**  

This repository contains all my project codes for the **Modern Robotics Specialization** by Northwestern University. The specialization consists of six subsequent courses covering fundamental and advanced robotics concepts, culminating in a **capstone project** where I developed motion planning and control algorithms for a **KUKA YouBot** mobile manipulator to perform a manipulation task.  

## **Courses & Projects**

# Usage & Contributions

Feel free to explore the projects and use the code for reference.  
Contributions, discussions, and improvements are always welcome!

## Note

This specialization also facilitates programming with Python using the **Modern Robotics Library** linked above.  
I chose to implement my projects in **MATLAB** due to university licensing availability, but all tasks can also be completed in **Python**.
