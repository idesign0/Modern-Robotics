# **Modern Robotics Specialization ‚Äì Project Repository**  

This repository contains all my project codes for the **Modern Robotics Specialization** by Northwestern University. The specialization consists of six subsequent courses covering fundamental and advanced robotics concepts, culminating in a **capstone project** where I developed motion planning and control algorithms for a **KUKA YouBot** mobile manipulator to perform a manipulation task.
